# Welcome to the Toolshed!
We're glad you're here. We've put together a collection of useful tools that we hope you'll find helpful.
Here are a few of our most popular tools:
Find your IP address: This tool will tell you your IP address, which is a unique identifier for your computer on the internet.
Display a random API quote: This tool will display a random quote from an API, which is a set of programming instructions that allow you to access data or functionality from another website or application.
Generate a random password: This tool will generate a random password that is strong and secure.
Convert between different units of measurement:This tool will convert between different units of measurement, such as meters and feet, or pounds and kilograms.
Dictionary: Our dictionary tool allows you to look up the definition of any word in the English language. Simply enter the word you want to look up and our tool will return the definition, as well as other related information such as synonyms, antonyms, and examples of how the word is used in a sentence. Our dictionary tool is powered by a large database of words and definitions, so you can be sure to find the information you're looking for. We also update our database regularly to ensure that you have access to the latest definitions.
We're always adding new tools, so be sure to check back often. And if you have any suggestions for new tools, please let us know.
Thanks for visiting the Toolshed!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
